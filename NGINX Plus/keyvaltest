Iâ€™ve just created a tiny PoC with your case and found that keyval directive works as expected.
keyval_zone zone=green:128k state=/var/db/nginx/state/green.keyval;
keyval $http_my_cookie $my_var zone=green;
server {
    listen 8088;
    location /api {
        api write=on;
    }
    location = /dashboard.html {
        root /usr/local/www/nginx-dist;
    }
}
server {
    listen 8080;
    return 200 "OK!\nmy_var=$my_var\n";
}
