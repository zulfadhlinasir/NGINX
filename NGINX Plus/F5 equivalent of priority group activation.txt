upstream backend {
  server 1.1.1.1;
  server 2.2.2.2 backup;
}
You can also use 2 backup servers:
upstream backend {
  server 1.1.1.1;
  server 2.2.2.2 backup;
  server 3.3.3.3 backup;
}
But in this case, when primary server is down, requests will be load-balanced between two backup servers. There's no convenient way to configure "backup of backup". Only rather ugly workaround is possible:
upstream backend {
  server 1.1.1.1;
  server 127.0.0.1:8888 backup;
}
upstream backups {
  server 2.2.2.2;
  server 3.3.3.3 backup;
server {
  listen 80;
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://backend;
  }
}
server {
  listen 127.0.0.1:8888; 
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://backups;
  }
}
